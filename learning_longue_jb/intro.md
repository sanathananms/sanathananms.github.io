# Welcome to Learning Longue

This is a brief sample book designed to provide you with an overview of the topics, projects, and leisure activities that I am engaged in. The content primarily consists of notes I've taken while learning from courses, attending conferences/workshops, preparing lectures, and gathering random information. It does not delve deeply into any specific topic, and the contents are not extensively organized. 

For more details, please refer to the content pages included with this sample book.
