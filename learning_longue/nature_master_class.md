# Effectively Communicating your Research
## Designing  an impactful research study
- Upload contensts in Data repositories of the failed research
- SMART
    - Specific:
    - Measure: Methodology
    - Achievable: Resourse, Facilities
    - Realistic: budget
    - Timely:  

To study of the Risk: Cohort>Case control> Cross-sectional study

There are many journals and database avaible where standard protocols are discussed in detailed. (eg. Nature. PLOS, etc.)

## Effective academic writing
Important strategies:
- Be concisie
  - Length of a sentence: 10-20 words per sentence.
  - present one idea before going to the next
  - avoid unnecessary words that dilute the idea
    - ~~it is well know that~~ most therapies for 
    - ~~As a matter of fact~~, we found...
    - ~~A number of studies have shown that~~...
    - **A few studies**....
    - ~~it is worth mentioninting that~~...
    - ... ~~as described in the previous study.~~
- Be specific
  - Avoild: this, that these, those, they, it
  - Avoid using qualitative words for quantitative thingd: Some, most, about, few
  - Avoid Subjective words: Surprisingly, interestingly, strikingly (use only once of twice in the entite paper to address the keypoint)
- Be logical
  - Use variety in signposting to guide your readers
    - Contrast words
    - Similar words
    - Addition words
    - Results words
  - Sentence should end with **"stress position"** and next sentence should be followed by **"topic position"**

Another Important starategies: 
- Active voice
  - Sujects are verbs has to be together (dont seperate it as we do in passive voice)
  - Avoid using the verbs at the end of the sentence.
  - Some journal (Nature)clearly says article prefers active voice
  - When should we use passive voice?
    - to avoid repetation ( He blah bla.... "He"........ "He")
    - Unclear subjects - to avoid subjects that we do not know 
    - Methods section: ~~We proposed~~..... **This techniques....**
    - Sentence structure
  - Generally in a papaer 75% will be active voice and 25% in passive voice
- Strong words
  - Avoid normalization: 
    - **Correlate** ~~correlation~~, 
    - **improve** ~~improvement~~
    - **restore** ~~restoration~~
    - **investigate** ~~investigation~~
  - Avoid using complex words:
    - nature portfolio: clear and simply
    - Use this website to commonly used words [Academic Phrasebank](https://www.phrasebank.manchester.ac.uk)
**Effective promts for LLMs
1. Identigy who you are: Bio medical researcher
2. Give LLM contest for your prompt: Scientific publishing
    Avoid putting Researching findings in ChatGPT/Gemini in the basic version
   - if necessary use it in Enterprise verions
3.  (to copy from the slides)

## Logical Manuscript Structure
Key points to consider
- Identify your audience
    - GLobal vs regional
    - Broad vs Specialized
    - Academic vs non-academic
- Identify your focus
- Structure your narrative
  - people like stories
    - flow
    - importance
    - attention

**Writing the flow**
1. Organize your ideas
   1. i.e wrte an outline
2. Communicate your ideas
3. Write section by section (reduce downtime and receive feedback more quickly)
   1. Methods
   2. Results
   3. Introduction/Discussion

- Use Collab: Google docs, Overleaf
- Set deadline
- Avoid using the "final" in the file name
- After the first draft, read a loud to
  - remove unnecessary words, 
  - terminology
  - spelling
  - ears can catch what eye has missed

#### Contents of the paper:
**Introduction**
- intoduce the topic
- why it is relevent?
  - international vs regional
    - (to copy from the slides)
  - Broad vs specialized
- in introduction cite the most recent pappers (make sure than 2/3rd of the ref are from last 5 years)
- organize in this way:
  - Claim about the topic
  - Support for evidence: Introduce previous studies/referxe based on the above calim
  - Further anlysis: Emplasis need for more studies

**methodology**
- Who and what was used in the study?
  - Power calculation
  - Sampling methodology

**Results**
- Logically guide your readers
  - always go for short paragrapht with 4-5 sentences
  - make sure every figures are explained before going to the next
  - Logical flow of the figure descriptions
    - Intoduce the figure
    - Discuss trends/pattenrs/relationship
    - Summary/takeaway message
- How the result sof the figures to written?
    - Rationale
    - introduce the trend and patterns
    - Importance

**Discussions**
- re-introduce the study to keep the ready
  - topics importance 
  - what you did
  - key findings
  - what is the value
- Use hedging terms to avoid confusion in the reader: may, suggest
- Report negative results
  - Prevent research waste
  - while reporting negative results:
    - report the negative results
    - Interpretatation
    - Generate new hypothesis
**Conclusion**
- Conclusion: Main Conclusion
- Key findings: 1-2 Most important findings
- Impications: immediate contribution to the field
- Thought leadership: what is the value to the field
  
*Finally promote your research!*
- Conference
- Social media
  - Put the conclusion first
  - then summary and key findings
  - highlight the applications
- Press releases/media
